Innovation requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with people and the courage to challenge the old dogma and the conventional wisdom. We here at TechMart believe that innovation and courage lie at the very heart of entrepreneurship and we strive to kickstart the chain reaction of transformation of ideas into real materialistic success.The motto of this year's Techmart is "Startup India, Standup India". It is a fortunate co-incidence that our goal aligns with the latest government schemes of promoting entrepreneurship among young engineers with innovative ideas. India needs a fresh minted idea that will start a revolution and turn India into a major manufacturing power. Techmart 2015 provides a platform to showcase such innovation.
